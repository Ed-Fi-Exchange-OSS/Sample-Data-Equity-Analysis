# Ed-Fi Sample Data Equity Analysis

## Goal

The Ed-Fi Alliance's sample data sets have realistic but fictional names,
attached to realistic but fictional schools and local education agencies. Do
these data sets unduly perpetuate any demographic biases or demographic skew
with respect to key student performance indicators?

To this end, we have developed a Jupyter Notebook for performing rigorous
statistical analysis on an ODS database:

Detailed write-ups will be provided here on all three Ed-Fi sample data sets,
once available.
